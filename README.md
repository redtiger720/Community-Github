Codes to use in Git Bash:
1. "cd" 'points-to' the folder you want to open/select on your PC. Use this to find the local repository folder.
2. "ls" (mac)/"dir" (win) 'shows all folders and files it contains'.
3. "git branch" checks/shows-you WHICH BRANCH of your local repository you have 'currently selected' (i.e. an Asterisk (*) means that's the HEAD, the one you're currently targeting.)
4. "git checkout" or "git switch" followed by the Branch Name lets you change to the BRANCH that you want to 'add and commit changes to'.
5. "git status" shows any 'Untracked & Uncommitted' changes in RED text; shows 'Committed but Unpushed' changes, or 'Committed & Pushed' changes in GREEN text.
7. "git add ." (i.e. git, add, full-stop) ADDS the command for the GitHub Remote repository to TRACK ALL local changes recently made to the local repository folder and files on your PC.
8. "git commit -m "message" 'commits/saves a checkpoint' or lets GitHub know, that there are 'changes Ready to be Pushed' to the REMOTE repository.
9. "git push" pushes all recent commits to the REMOTE repository on GitHub.
10. "git pull" allows you to update your LOCAL repository on your PC, with 'all recent commits' to the Remote repository, by your team Collaborators.
